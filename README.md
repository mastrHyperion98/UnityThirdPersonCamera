# UnityThirdPersonCamera
A C# Unity Script that creates a camera that follows the player and avoids obstacles

# Requirements
* Unity Engine (created on 2019.4.x LTS) prior and newer versions should work, but have not been tested. 
* User must manually update how they handle the input to fit the design of their project. 

# Please Note: 
* I wrote this script very quickly and it will be some time, before I actually make use of it in such a way where I can properly test it for bugs and inconsistent behaviours. 
* This may not be the most efficient way to do this. Cinemachine offers a lot of baked in tools that automates this process. 
* Should be used for reference mostly for new users of Unity who are completely lost as to how to handle a task like this one.
* The camera does not need to be a child of the target object.
